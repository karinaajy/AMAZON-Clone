    const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
      email, password
    })
    if (error) throw error
    return data
  },
  
  // Register (email verification disabled, immediately available)
  createUserWithEmailAndPassword: async (email, password) => {
    // Auto-login logic to enhance user experience
  },
  
  // Listen for authentication state changes
  onAuthStateChanged: (callback) => {
    return supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {
      callback(session?.user || null)
    })
  }
}
```

#### 3.1.3 Key Problems Solved

The authentication system of this project successfully solved the following key problems:

      user: null,          // Current user
      
      addToBasket: (item) => {
        set((state) => ({ basket: [...state.basket, item] }))
      },
      
      removeFromBasket: (id) => {
        // Only remove the first matching item (supports multiple identical items)
      },
      
      getBasketTotal: () => {
        return get().basket?.reduce((amount, item) => item.price + amount, 0) || 0
      }
    }),
    {
      name: 'amazon-storage',
      storage: createJSONStorage(() => localStorage),
      partialize: (state) => ({ basket: state.basket, user: state.user })
    }
  )
)
```

#### 3.2.3 Key Problems Solved

The state management system of this project successfully solved the following key problems:

- Persistent retention of shopping cart data after page refresh

### 3.3 Online Payment System

#### 3.3.1 Technology Selection

This project adopts Stripe as the payment processing platform, combined with Supabase Edge Functions to implement server-side payment logic.

#### 3.3.2 Architecture Design

This project designed a secure payment flow architecture:

```
Frontend (React) 
  ↓ Request to create payment intent
Supabase Edge Function (Deno)
  ↓ Call Stripe API
Stripe Server
  ↓ Return client_secret
Frontend collects card information
  ↓ Confirm payment
Stripe processes payment
  ↓ Return payment result
Frontend saves order
```

The main advantages of using Edge Functions include:

1. Hide Stripe private key, improving security
2. Server-side creates payment intent, preventing amount tampering
3. No need to maintain independent backend server
4. Auto-scaling, pay-as-you-go

#### 3.3.3 Implementation Solution

```javascript
// Frontend: Create payment intent
const response = await axios({
  method: 'post',
  url: `/payments/create?total=${getBasketTotal() * 100}` // Convert to cents
})
setClientSecret(response.data.client_secret)

// Frontend: Confirm payment
const { error, paymentIntent } = await stripe.confirmCardPayment(
  clientSecret,
  { payment_method: { card: cardElement } }
)

// Edge Function: Handle payment request
const stripeResponse = await fetch('https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${stripeSecretKey}` },
  body: new URLSearchParams({
    amount: total,
    currency: 'usd'
  })
})
```

#### 3.3.4 Key Problems Solved

The payment system of this project successfully solved the following key problems:

- Secure payment processing (PCI DSS compliant)
- Prevention of amount tampering attacks
- Support for multiple payment methods
- Automatic handling of payment failures and retry mechanisms

---

### 3.4 Order Management System

#### 3.4.1 Technology Selection

This project adopts a dual storage strategy combining Supabase Database and LocalStorage. The advantages of this design are:

- **Supabase (Primary Storage):** Cloud persistence, supports multi-device synchronization
- **LocalStorage (Backup):** Local cache, improves loading speed, supports offline access

#### 3.4.2 Database Design

```sql
-- orders table structure
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  payment_intent_id TEXT UNIQUE,
  basket JSONB,              -- Store shopping cart snapshot
  amount INTEGER,            -- Payment amount (cents)
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Index optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_created_at ON orders(created_at DESC);
```

#### 3.4.3 Implementation Solution

```javascript
// Save order (dual storage)
const order = {
  user_id: user.id,
  payment_intent_id: paymentIntent.id,
  basket: basket,
  amount: paymentIntent.amount,
  created_at: new Date().toISOString()
}

// 1. Save to LocalStorage (immediate effect)
const existingOrders = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('orders') || '[]')
existingOrders.push(order)
localStorage.setItem('orders', JSON.stringify(existingOrders))

// 2. Save to Supabase (cloud persistence)
try {
  await db.saveOrder(user.id, order)
} catch (dbError) {
  console.log('Supabase not available, using local storage')
}

// Fetch orders (prioritize cloud)
const fetchOrders = async () => {
  try {
    ordersData = await db.getUserOrders(user.id)
  } catch (dbError) {
    // Fallback to LocalStorage
    const localOrders = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('orders') || '[]')
    ordersData = localOrders.filter(order => order.user_id === user.id)
  }
}
```

#### 3.4.4 Real-time Order Updates

```javascript
// Supabase Realtime subscription
subscription = db.subscribeToOrders(user.id, () => {
  fetchOrders() // Auto-refresh when new orders arrive
})
```

#### 3.4.5 Key Problems Solved

The order management system of this project successfully solved the following key problems:

- Reliable storage of order data
- Fast loading of order history
- Support for offline order viewing
- Real-time order status updates
- Degradation strategy ensures system availability

```javascript
<Router>
  <Routes>
    {/* Login page (independent layout) */}
    <Route path="/login" element={<Login />} />
    
    {/* Main application (with Header) */}
    <Route path="/*" element={
      <>
        <Header />
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="/checkout" element={<Checkout />} />
          <Route path="/orders" element={<Orders />} />
          <Route path="/payment" element={
            <Elements stripe={stripePromise}>
              <Payment />
            </Elements>
          } />
        </Routes>
      </>
    } />
  </Routes>
</Router>
```

#### 3.5.3 Design Considerations

The routing architecture of this project is based on the following design considerations:

1. Login page uses independent layout without navigation bar
2. Other pages share Header component
3. Payment page requires special handling (Stripe Elements Provider)
4. Nested routing improves code reusability

## 4. Key Technical Challenges and Solutions

### 4.1 Stripe Blocked by Browser Tracking Protection

#### 4.1.1 Problem Description

```
net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT
```
In the development environment, browser ad blockers and tracking protection features block Stripe.js from loading.

#### 4.1.2 Solution

This project adopted the following solutions:

1. **Temporary Solution:** Disable ad blockers in the browser or add exceptions
2. **Long-term Solution:** 
   - Use Stripe official CDN
   - Add error prompts to guide users
   - This issue typically doesn't occur in production environments

#### 4.1.3 Technical Implementation

```javascript
// Use official loadStripe method
import { loadStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-js'
const stripePromise = loadStripe('pk_test_...')

// Error handling
if (!stripe || !elements) {
  setError('Unable to load payment system. Please disable ad blockers.')
  return
}
```

---

### 4.2 Supabase Email Verification Affects User Experience

#### 4.2.1 Problem Description

By default, Supabase requires users to verify their email after registration before logging in, which provides a poor experience in development and demo environments.

#### 4.2.2 Solution

This project adopted solutions at both configuration and code levels:

1. **Configuration Level:** Disable email verification in `config.toml`
```toml
[auth.email]
enable_signup = true
enable_confirmations = false  # Key configuration
```

2. **Code Level:** Implement automatic login after registration
```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email, password,
  options: { emailRedirectTo: undefined }
})

// If registration succeeds but no session, auto-login
if (data.user && !data.session) {
  const loginResult = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
    email, password
  })
  return loginResult.data
}
```

#### 4.2.3 Implementation Results

Through the above solutions, this project achieved:

- Users can use the system immediately after registration
- Simplified development and testing process
- Enhanced demo effectiveness

---

### 4.3 Shopping Cart State Persistence

#### 4.3.1 Problem Description

Shopping cart data is lost after users refresh the page, severely affecting user experience.

#### 4.3.2 Solution

This project uses Zustand's `persist` middleware to automatically synchronize state to LocalStorage.

#### 4.3.3 Technical Implementation

```javascript
export const useAmazonStore = create(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({ /* state and methods */ }),
    {
      name: 'amazon-storage',
      storage: createJSONStorage(() => localStorage),
      partialize: (state) => ({ 
        basket: state.basket,  // Only persist needed fields
        user: state.user 
      })
    }
  )
)
```

#### 4.3.4 Solution Advantages

This solution has the following advantages:

- Automatic serialization/deserialization
- Support for partial state persistence
- Switchable storage methods (localStorage/sessionStorage)

---

### 4.4 Payment Amount Security

#### 4.4.1 Problem Description

If payment intents are created directly on the frontend, malicious users may tamper with payment amounts, creating security risks.

#### 4.4.2 Solution

This project uses Supabase Edge Functions to create payment intents on the server side, ensuring payment security.

#### 4.4.3 Security Flow

```
1. Frontend sends shopping cart total to Edge Function
2. Edge Function validates and creates payment intent
3. Returns client_secret to frontend
4. Frontend uses client_secret to complete payment
```

#### 4.4.4 Key Code Implementation

```javascript
// Edge Function (server-side)
const total = url.searchParams.get('total')
const stripeResponse = await fetch('https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${stripeSecretKey}` },
  body: new URLSearchParams({ amount: total, currency: 'usd' })
})
```

#### 4.4.5 Security Guarantees

The payment security mechanism of this project provides the following guarantees:

- Stripe private key not exposed to frontend
- Payment amount validated on server side
- Compliant with PCI DSS security standards

---

### 4.5 Order Data Reliability

#### 4.5.1 Problem Description

If the Supabase database table is not created or network failure occurs, order data may be lost, affecting system reliability.

#### 4.5.2 Solution

This project implements a dual storage strategy (Supabase + LocalStorage) to ensure data reliability.

#### 4.5.3 Degradation Strategy Implementation

```javascript
try {
  // Prioritize Supabase
  await db.saveOrder(user.id, order)
} catch (dbError) {
  // Fallback to LocalStorage
  console.log('Using local storage as fallback')
}

// Also use degradation strategy when reading
try {
  ordersData = await db.getUserOrders(user.id)
} catch (dbError) {
  const localOrders = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('orders') || '[]')
  ordersData = localOrders.filter(order => order.user_id === user.id)
}
```

#### 4.5.4 Solution Advantages

This solution has the following advantages:

- Improves system availability
- Prevents data loss
- Supports offline order viewing
- Smooth error handling
